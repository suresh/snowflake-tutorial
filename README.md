# Snowflake Tutorial
In this tutorial, we would be going through the process of setting Snowflake with sample warehouse. Next, we would be loading a data file onto this warehouse. Last, we would be running sample queries on this warehouse.

## Create Snowflake user profiles

Snowflake uses roles to control the objects (virtual warehouses, databases, tables, etc.) that users can access:

* Snowflake provides a set of predefined roles, as well as a framework for defining a hierarchy of custom roles.
* All Snowflake users are automatically assigned the predefined PUBLIC role, which enables login to Snowflake and basic object access.
* In addition to the PUBLIC role, each user can be assigned additional roles, with one of these roles designated as their default role. A userâ€™s default role determines the role used in the Snowflake sessions initiated by the user; however, this is only a default. Users can change roles within a session at any time.
* Roles can be assigned at user creation or afterwards.

You can read more from [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/admin-user-management.html#user-roles).

### Sample script for creating users & roles
To help with this workshop, here is the script for [creating user profiles](scripts/user_profiles.sql)

## Data Loading Steps

Here is the process for loading external data files (CSV, JSON or Parquet):
* Create File Format Objects 
* Create Stage Objects 
* Stage the Data Files 
* List the Stages Data Files 
* Copy Data into Target Tables 
* Resolve Data Errors if any 
* Verify loaded data 
* Remove successfully loaded data files 

### Sample script for creating staging area & data loading
Here is the script for [loading data into Snowflake](scripts/data_loading.sql). Please execute the script up to creation of staging area.


Then we need to put the json data file using either snowsql cli tool as: 
```bash
snowsql -a wg30470.us-east-1 -u etl_user -r anl_write -w etl_write_xs -d sflk_s -s dim	
```
Or, we can use a [python script](load_utils/load_json.py) to load this json file onto staging area.
```bash
load_utils/load_json.py suresh of96327.us-east-1 etl_write_xs sflk_s dim
```

After loading the file to staging area continue with `COPY INTO` command and see the results of the relational table.

## Sample Queries

We would be using sample database TPC-H bundled with Snowflake for this section. The components of TPC-H consist of eight separate and individual tables (the Base Tables). The relationships between columns in these tables are illustrated in the following ER diagram:

![schema](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/_images/sample-data-tpch-schema.png)

Now let's do some BI on the sample data. 

### Q1: Pricing Summary Report Query
This query reports the amount of business that was billed, shipped, and returned.

### Business Question
The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all line items shipped as of a given date. The date is within 60-120 days of the greatest ship date contained in the database.

Here is the query,

```sql
use schema snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1;   -- or snowflake_sample_data.{tpch_sf10 | tpch_sf100 | tpch_sf1000}

select
       l_returnflag,
       l_linestatus,
       sum(l_quantity) as sum_qty,
       sum(l_extendedprice) as sum_base_price,
       sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)) as sum_disc_price,
       sum(l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount) * (1+l_tax)) as sum_charge,
       avg(l_quantity) as avg_qty,
       avg(l_extendedprice) as avg_price,
       avg(l_discount) as avg_disc,
       count(*) as count_order
 from
       lineitem
 where
       l_shipdate <= dateadd(day, -90, to_date('1998-12-01'))
 group by
       l_returnflag,
       l_linestatus
 order by
       l_returnflag,
       l_linestatus;
```

## FAQ

1. What is the difference between securityadmin and sysadmin roles. Why do we get a sysadmin default.
